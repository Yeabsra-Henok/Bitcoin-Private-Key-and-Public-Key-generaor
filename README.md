This py code generated a Bitcoin private and public key. 

Generating a Private Key:
The script first imports the os module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It uses the os.urandom() function to generate 32 random bytes, ensuring cryptographic security.
These random bytes are then converted into a 256-bit integer, which serves as the private key for a Bitcoin wallet. This private key is generated using the generate_private_key() function.
Elliptic Curve Arithmetic:
The script defines several functions (point_addition(), point_double(), point_scalar_multiplication(), and compress_point()) to perform elliptic curve arithmetic on the secp256k1 curve, which is the curve used in Bitcoin.
These functions implement the necessary mathematical operations for adding points, doubling points, scalar multiplication, and compressing points on the elliptic curve.
Deriving the Public Key:
The derive_public_key() function takes the generated private key as input and computes the corresponding compressed public key using elliptic curve arithmetic.
It performs scalar multiplication of the base point

G by the private key to obtain the public key point.
Encoding Keys:
The private key is encoded in Wallet Import Format (WIF) using the encode_wif_private_key() function. This involves adding a prefix byte (0x80) to indicate a private key, appending a suffix byte (0x01) to indicate compressed format, and calculating and appending a 4-byte checksum.
The public key is encoded using Base58Check encoding, which is commonly used for Bitcoin addresses. This involves adding a prefix byte (0x00) to indicate a public key, appending a byte to indicate compression, and calculating and appending a 4-byte checksum.
Printing Keys:
Finally, the script prints both the private key (in WIF format) and the public key (in Base58Check encoding) to the terminal.
This process ensures that the generated keys are compatible with the Bitcoin network and can be used for transactions and address generation.
